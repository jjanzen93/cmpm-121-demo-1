This is the starter code project for the `Demo 1` project in CMPM 121, Game Development Patterns, at UC Santa Cruz (fall quarter, 2024). Students should incrementally modify this project, tracking their progress with git, to develop an incremental game of their own unique design.

"World of Mine" (https://raywang0416.github.io/cmpm-121-demo-1/) inspired me by listing the current cost in addition to the quantity of a purchased upgrade. In my game, only the quantity was listed. From there, the cost could theoretically be extrapolated by multiplying the original cost by 1.15^x where x is the quantity, but that isn't very obvious (and the original cost is not indicated anywhere in-game). After adding this display to the button text, it's much more clear how long one will need to wait to unlock an upgrade, which can help the user determine if they'd like to save up for the next one or not.

"Turtle Tapper" (https://collectioncard.github.io/Turtle-Tapper/) inspired me with its large circular button, which I feel gave a lot of visual clarity to the game and is a central feature of many clicker-style games. To do this, I learned a bit about CSS and specifically set the width and height to be equal (to ensure a circle rather than an oval), did the same with the horizontal and vertical padding (to keep the steak emoji in the center of the button), increased the size of the emoji, and made the border radius 50%, which fully eliminates all corners and sides.
